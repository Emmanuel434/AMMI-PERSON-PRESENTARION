# Linear Quadratic  Regulators (AMMI-Ghana)

This repository is a presentation on Linear Quadratic  Regulators:

This was presented to students at the African Masters in Machine Intelligence.


[1. LQR](#1)

* A linear quadratic problem is a problem where the system dynamics
are described by a set of linear differential equations and the cost is
described by a quadratic function.


* The goal of linear quadratic problem (LQR) is to stabilize a system
